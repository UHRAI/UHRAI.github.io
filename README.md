# The Maze Project - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to "The Maze" project, a captivating exploration into the intersection of maze-solving algorithms and immersive 3D graphics. This project showcases the transformation of a 2D map into a navigable 3D world using ray casting. As a Full Stack Developer, I embarked on this journey to create a gaming experience where players navigate through visually stimulating mazes.

## Inspiration

"The Maze" project was born out of a personal fascination with maze puzzles and a deep-seated curiosity about the technical aspects of 3D graphics. The desire to craft a captivating gaming experience served as the driving force behind this endeavor. The inspiration stems from childhood love for mazes and the challenge of merging algorithms with creative design.

## Timeline

The journey commenced as a personal exploration, evolving into a passion project that combined programming prowess with creative design. The initial spark ignited on Dec 1, 2023, at 4:00 AM, and the development continued to evolve, culminating in a refined project that exceeded initial expectations.
